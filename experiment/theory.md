## Algebraic Equation
An algebraic equation is a mathematical statement that shows the equality between two algebraic expressions. It generally consists of variables, constants, and coefficients, connected using arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

A standard form of an algebraic equation is written as:

P(x) = 0

where 

P(x) represents a polynomial in the variable x.

For example:

x + 5 = 12

An equation is considered balanced when both sides have the same numerical value. To solve an equation, mathematical operations must be applied equally to both sides to maintain this balance.

The primary objective in solving algebraic equations is to find the value(s) of the variable that satisfy the equality. These values are known as the solutions or roots of the equation.

Algebraic equations can be classified based on the degree of the polynomial involved:

Linear equations — Degree 1

Quadratic equations — Degree 2

Cubic equations — Degree 3

Higher degree equations — Degree 4 or more

Algebraic equations form the basis of numerous real-world mathematical models used in science, engineering, economics, and technology, helping to describe relationships and solve practical problems.

## Transcendental Equation

A **transcendental equation** is an equation that contains **transcendental functions** such as exponential, logarithmic, trigonometric, or inverse trigonometric functions.  

Unlike algebraic equations, transcendental equations typically do not have **closed-form solutions** and often require numerical or iterative methods to solve.  


## Key Differences Between Algebraic and Transcendental Equations  

| Feature | Algebraic Equation | Transcendental Equation |
|---------|--------------------|--------------------------|
| Functions Used | Polynomials only | Exponential, logarithmic, trigonometric, etc. |
| Solutions | Often exact (closed-form) | Usually approximate (numerical methods) |

## Insight

- **Algebraic equations** are simpler to solve since they deal with polynomials, and exact roots can often be found using formulas (e.g., quadratic formula).  
- **Transcendental equations** are more complex and require iterative techniques for finding approximate solutions, as exact solutions are rare.  
- In real-life applications:  
  - Algebraic equations appear in problems like **motion, finance, and geometry**.  
  - Transcendental equations arise in **physics, engineering, signal processing, and control systems**.
