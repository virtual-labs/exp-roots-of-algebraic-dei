# Theory

## Algebraic Equation

An **algebraic equation** is an equation expressed in the form:  

$$
P(x) = 0
$$  

where \( P(x) \) is a polynomial.  

For example:  

$$
x + 8 = 0
$$  

Here, \( x + 8 \) is a polynomial, and therefore the equation is called a **polynomial equation**.  

An algebraic equation is always **balanced**, meaning that the values on both sides of the equation are equal. It generally consists of **variables, coefficients, and constants**.  

Consider the equation:  

$$
1 + 1 = 2
$$  

This is balanced, since both sides have the same value. When manipulating algebraic equations, any operation performed on one side must also be performed on the other side to preserve balance.  

For example, adding 5 to both sides:  

$$
1 + 1 + 5 = 2 + 5
$$  

The same principle applies for **subtraction, multiplication, and division**. As long as identical operations are performed on both sides, the equation remains balanced.  

The **solution of an algebraic equation** involves finding values of the variables that satisfy the equation. Such values are called the **roots of the equation**.

## Transcendental Equation

A **transcendental equation** is an equation that contains **transcendental functions** such as exponential, logarithmic, trigonometric, or inverse trigonometric functions.  

Unlike algebraic equations, transcendental equations typically do not have **closed-form solutions** and often require numerical or iterative methods to solve.  

### Examples:

$$
x = e^{-x}, \quad x = \cos(x), \quad 2x = x^2
$$  

---

## Example Problem

**Find \( \frac{dy}{dx} \) for the function:**  

$$
y = \ln(\tan(x) + \sec(x))
$$  

### Solution:  

First, recall the derivative rule:  

$$
\frac{d}{dx}[\ln(f(x))] = \frac{f'(x)}{f(x)}
$$  

Here,  

$$
f(x) = \tan(x) + \sec(x)
$$  

Now differentiate:  

$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{d}{dx}[\ln(\tan(x) + \sec(x))]
$$  

$$
= \frac{\sec^2(x) + \sec(x)\tan(x)}{\tan(x) + \sec(x)}
$$  

Simplify the numerator:  

$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{\sec(x)(\tan(x) + \sec(x))}{\tan(x) + \sec(x)}
$$  

Cancel terms:  

$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = \sec(x)
$$

## Key Takeaways

- **Algebraic equations** involve polynomials and are always balanced.  
- **Transcendental equations** involve functions like exponential, logarithmic, or trigonometric and usually require numerical solutions.  
- Derivatives of such equations often simplify elegantly with proper application of calculus rules.  


## Key Differences Between Algebraic and Transcendental Equations  

| Feature | Algebraic Equation | Transcendental Equation |
|---------|--------------------|--------------------------|
| Functions Used | Polynomials only | Exponential, logarithmic, trigonometric, etc. |
| Solutions | Often exact (closed-form) | Usually approximate (numerical methods) |
| Example | \( x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0 \) | \( x = \cos x \) |

## Additional Understanding  

- **Algebraic equations** are simpler to solve since they deal with polynomials, and exact roots can often be found using formulas (e.g., quadratic formula).  
- **Transcendental equations** are more complex and require iterative techniques for finding approximate solutions, as exact solutions are rare.  
- In real-life applications:  
  - Algebraic equations appear in problems like **motion, finance, and geometry**.  
  - Transcendental equations arise in **physics, engineering, signal processing, and control systems**.
