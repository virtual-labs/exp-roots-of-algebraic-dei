## Procedure

1. **Select the Experiment Type**  
   From the experiment header, choose the type of equation you want to solve, such as an **algebraic equation** (linear, quadratic, or higher degree) or a **transcendental equation**.

2. **Specify the Mathematical Expression**  
   Enter the equation in the input field using the variable \( x \). Ensure that the equation is written in the standard form:
   \[
   f(x) = 0
   \]

3. **Choose the Numerical Method**  
   Select the numerical method to be applied (e.g., **Bisection Method** or **Regula Falsi Method**) from the available options.

4. **Set the Input Parameters**  
   - Enter the **initial guess** or **lower and upper bounds** (where applicable), ensuring that the function changes sign within the selected interval.  
   - Specify the **number of iterations** or allowable error tolerance, as required by the chosen method.

5. **Submit the Values**  
   Click the **Calculate** or **Submit** button to execute the numerical algorithm.

6. **Observe the Output**  
   Examine the computed **approximate root**, the number of iterations taken for convergence, and the corresponding function value \( f(x) \).  
   Observe the **graphical output**, which shows the function curve and the location of the root on the \( x \)-axis.

7. **Interpret the Results**  
   Verify whether the solution converges to a stable root and compare the results obtained using different numerical methods to understand their convergence behavior and accuracy.
