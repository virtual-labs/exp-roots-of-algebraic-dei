### About the Experiment  

This experiment focuses on numerical methods used to determine the roots of algebraic and transcendental equations that cannot be solved analytically. The study involves implementing iterative techniques such as the Bisection Method, Newton-Raphson Method, and Secant Method to approximate roots with desired accuracy. It helps students understand convergence criteria, error analysis, and practical applications of root-finding in scientific and engineering computations.
